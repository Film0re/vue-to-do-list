# Simple To-Do list made with Vue, NodeJS and Express

I made this project to help learn vue and along the way added some other features for fun.

I know visually it looks horrible, I am very new to css so I just tried to have fun with it.

Currently running it is very jank, you must run these two commands in separate terminals.
- npm run dev
- npm run server

It will host the website on http://localhost:5173/

Current Features:
- Saving
- Filterting/Sorting
- Deleting Items
